#### By: Emiko, Minoo, and Cameron

## Executive Statement

1. Problem Statement:

The COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted all of our communities. In some areas, the impact of the pandemic has been exasperated by other natural disasters. In the state of California, wildfires have been devasating in recent years. Being part of the ring of fire and laying on top of large number of faults, earthquakes are also a constant threat.
There is a shortage of tools available for looking at the combined effect of the pandemic and other natural disasters. This makes it challenging for decision makers to assess risk and make appropriate prepardness plans. Here, we will provide a tool to visualize the concurrence of COVID-19 hot spots, wildfires, and earthquakes in California.

2. Description of Data:

We used various sources for collection of the data, and data regardless of the source reflect information for 2020 only. We relied on the aggregated data from [Jonh Hopkins Resourse Center](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data) for COVID-19. Jonh Hopkins update their data daily. We collected [covid data](./data/california_covid.csv) on the most recent data as of October 17, 2020.
